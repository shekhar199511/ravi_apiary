# The respository solves the given problem statement : 

* Using this open-source API - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts, build an interface that shows lists of posts (use Vue).
* Provide a searchbar, when text is entered on the searchbar, for example, if "numquam" is entered, all items that contains numquam should be listed on screen.
* Add a post view page when post is clicked, take to view page - it should have dynamic routing (/post/view/:id).
* Provide 80% test coverage with Jest/Enzyme (Nice to have depending on your time).
